== What Is an API Community?

To drive developer adoption of your APIs, you must help them discover and learn how to use your APIs effectively, and provide a personalized, branded experience to motivate them to work with you. You must also engage with these developers during every step of their journey to ensure their success. Anypoint API Community Manager enables you to create this personalized, connected experience for your developers so they can interact with your APIs: APIs designed, cataloged, and managed in Anypoint Platform.

As a community administrator, you use API Community Manager to create a visually compelling digital experience that is consistent with your organization's brand identity. Your community showcases APIs that you select directly from https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange], plus other relevant content and self-service resources to inspire and help the developers you want to reach.

== A Connected and Personalized Digital Experience for Your Consumer Developers

A consumer developer accessing your API community finds news, events, tutorials, developer blog posts, and both business and technical information about your APIs, in a branded, customized experience.

Information in your community includes content created by your marketing and business development teams to help your audiences understand the value proposition of your APIs, in addition to the technical API documentation and self-service API console that helps developers explore API features and learn how to use them. The API technical information is made available directly from the API designs in Anypoint Platform.

Consumer developers can request access to your API for new or existing client applications, following the regular governance model of the API lifecycle provided by Anypoint Platform and https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/2.x/latest-overview-concept[API Manager]. Developers can manage their client applications, their access credentials (API keys and secrets), and get insights on their applications' performance as their applications use your APIs.

Developers use discussion forums to engage with your organization and other members of the community, by posting questions and answers, sharing ideas, and discussing issues they find.

Other API Community Manager features enable your organization to engage with partners and ensure that they are supported throughout their journey.
