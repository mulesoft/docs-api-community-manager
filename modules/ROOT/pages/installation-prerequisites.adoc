API Community Manager is installed in an *independent* Salesforce organization so that the API community is isolated
from customer operational data in their Salesforce instance, such as ERP or CRM data.

API Community Manager requires an ACM license. You cannot reuse an existing Salesforce license for ACM.

NOTE: Installing, updating or configuring API Community Manager must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the ACM Salesforce organization.
