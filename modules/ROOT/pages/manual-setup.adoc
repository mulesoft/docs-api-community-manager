To set up Anypoint API Community Manager manually, follow these steps.

== Set Up and Register a Domain and Enable Communities

To set up and register a domain:

. Log in to your API Community Manager https://login.salesforce.com/[Salesforce Organization, role=external, window=blank].
. Go to *Salesforce Set-up* by selecting the gear icon and selecting *Set-up*.
. Search for *My Domain* using the *Quick Find* box and then select *My Domain*.
. Enter a domain name for your organization. The name can include up to 34 letters, numbers, and hyphens.
. Select *Check Availability*. If the name is already taken, choose a different one.
. Select *Register Domain*.

You will receive a notification email when your domain is registered and your
subdomain name is ready for testing. This process can take a few minutes.
You can continue with the next steps while you wait for the email.

NOTE: After you complete API Community Manager installation and configuration, you can configure a full custom domain
name, also known as a vanity domain. When you're ready, refer to the Salesforce knowledge article
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000336819&type=1&mode=1[Run your Salesforce Community under a custom domain, role=external, window=blank].

Using the domain name you selected in the previous step, follow the steps in
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_enable.htm&type=5[Enable Salesforce Communities, role=external, window=blank]
to enable communities inside your Salesforce organization.

== Deploy Your Domain

Wait to receive the notification email that your domain is registered, and then deploy your domain:

. Log in to your API Community Manager https://login.salesforce.com/[Salesforce Organization, role=external, window=blank].
. Go to *Salesforce Set-up* by clicking the gear icon and selecting *Set-up*.
. Search for *My Domain* using the *Quick Find* box and then select *My Domain*.
. If the screen indicates your domain is ready, select *Log in*.
. Select *Deploy to Users*.

== Enable API Community Manager Control Panel

The API Community Manager control panel is the interface your community administrators and operators use to operate your communities. It is available in the *App Launcher* page, where it is the first icon displayed in the main navigation bar. To ensure that the control panel is available for admin users:

. In *Setup*, search for *App Manager* using the *Quick Find* box and click *App Manager*.
. Locate *API Community Manager* and, in the menu on the right end of the row, click *Edit*.
. Click *Navigation Items* in the left panel, select *ACM Administrator* under the *Available Items* box, and use the arrow buttons to move it to the *Selected Items* box. 
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Back* at the top right.
. Log out and log back in to your Salesforce organization.
. Open *App Launcher* and click *API Community Manager*.
. Verify that the API Community Manager control panel is displayed correctly by navigating to *Application Launcher* > *ACM Administrator*.
+
If you see a message that you have not created a community, then the steps in this task were performed correctly.

== Set Up the Data Bridge

The data bridge is the secure connection from Anypoint API Community Manager to your Anypoint Platform organization.

API Community Manager components and data objects use Anypoint Platform as their external data source.

=== Create a Key Pair

This key pair will be created in Salesforce and used for communication between Salesforce and Anypoint.

. Click *Setup* > *Security* > *Certificate and Key Management* > *Create Self-Signed Certificate*.
. Choose a *Label/Name* and remember the name you chose.
. Disable *Exportable Private Key*.
. Set *Key Size* to 2048 or larger.
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Download Certificate*.

The public key is saved on your local machine, and you will use it in the following steps.

=== Create Connected App in Anypoint

. Click *Access Management* > *Connected Apps* > *Create App*.
. Choose a name.
. Enable *App acts on behalf of a user*.
. In the section *Grant types* enable *JWT Bearer*.
. Copy the public key from the file downloaded in the previous steps and paste it into the public key text area.
+
The certificate must have the correct format, such as this:
+
----  
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----   
PUBLIC KEY
-----END CERTIFICATE-----  
----
+
. Set *Website URL* to `+https://login.salesforce.com+`.
. In the section *Redirect URIs* add `+http://localhost+`.
+
Connected apps require redirect URIs but this configuration does not use them.
. In the section *Who can use this application?* select *Members of this organization only*.
. In the section *Scopes* add *Background Access* and *Full Access*.
. Click *Save*.

You receive a client ID and a client secret. This configuration uses the certificate and does not use the client secret. Save the client ID so you can use it in the following steps.

=== Identity Provider Data

The following steps require the identity provider data you prepared in the xref:installation-prerequisites.adoc[Installation Prerequisites].

=== Create Named Credential

The following instructions use URLs for the US cloud that begin with `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/+`. If you are using the EU cloud, substitute `+https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/+`. If you are using MuleSoft Government Cloud, substitute `+https://gov.anypoint.mulesoft.com/+`.

. Click *Setup* > *Security* > *Named Credentials*.
. Create a named credential with the name `Anypoint`.
. Set *URL* to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com+`.
. Go to the *Authentication* section.
. Set *Identity Type* to *Per User*.
. Set *Authentication Protocol* to *JWT Token Exchange*.
. Set *Token Endpoint Url* to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token+`.
. Set *Issuer* to the client ID of the connected app you saved previously.
. Set *Per User Subject* to the following formula.
+
Replace `IDP_ISSUER` with the issuer from your IdP configuration. Replace `IDP_AUDIENCE` with the audience from your IdP configuration.
+
`"IDP_ISSUER:IDP_AUDIENCE|" &  $User.Username & "|" & $User.FirstName & "|" & $User.LastName & "|" & $User.Email & "|[\"Community User\"]"`
. Set *Audiences* to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token+`.
. Set *Token Valid for* to 60 minutes (the Anypoint default) or less.
. Set *JWT Signing Certificate* to the key that you created previously as described in the section Create a Key Pair.
. In the *Callout Options* section, enable *Generate Authorization Header*.

=== Modify External Data Source

. Click *Setup* > *Integrations* > *External Data Source* > *Exchange*.
. Set *URL* to `callout:Anypoint/odatabridge/odata.svc/`.
. Go to the *Authentication* section.
. Set *Identity* to *Anonymous*.
. Set *Authentication Protocol* to *No Authentication Protocol*.
. Click *Save*.
. Click *Setup* > *Integrations* > *External Data Source* > *Exchange*.
. In the section *Custom HTTP Headers*, set *X-Auth-Proto* to the value `'JWT'`, including the single quotes.
. Click *Save*.

== User Configuration

Give your user the *Exchange Contributor* role:

. In your Anypoint Platform organization, click *Access Management* > *Users*.
. Select your user.
. Click *Role* > *Add role by name*.
. Add the role *Exchange Contributor*.

Map community user to Anypoint role:

. Ensure that you have Exchange Administrator permissions.
. In your Anypoint Platform organization, navigate to *Access Management* and click *Roles*.
. In *Exchange Viewers*, set a new External group called `Community User` and save it.
