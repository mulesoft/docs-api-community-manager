The design of the developer experience in your community can include the capability for members to submit support cases. 

Support cases can be forwarded to a third-party issue tracking or support system through a custom integration. 
They can also be forwarded to an existing Salesforce organization with Service Cloud support capability.

Contact your MuleSoft representative to enable these capabilities.
