If calling a real endpoint from the console shows an *Unauthorized Endpoint* error:

. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open your community's content security policy (CSP) trusted sites list.
. Ensure that the list includes the endpoint site domain.

The console works in the user's browser and can call only trusted endpoint sites.
