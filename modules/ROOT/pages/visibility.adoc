Anypoint API Community Manager uses visibility rules to make APIs visible to selected groups of users.

For example, your community could have a Payment API and a Trade API visible to the financial developers team of three users, and have an Order Submission API visible to the retail developers team of two other users.

API visibility rules use the Salesforce object CommunityApi to represent each API published in your community, and Salesforce https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.user_groups.htm&type=5[Public Groups, role=external, window=blank] and https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.security_about_sharing_rules.htm&type=5[Sharing Rules, role=external, window=blank] to provide a flexible permissions model.

== Visibility Setup

To set up API visibility, configure your community to enable visibility, define your member groups, and define visibility rules to grant the groups permission to see APIs.

=== Enable Visibility

Follow these steps to configure your community for API visibility:

. Create a new *ACM Community User Plus* profile based on the *Customer Community User Plus* profile:
.. Click *Salesforce Setup* > *Profiles*.
.. Select *Customer Community User Plus*.
.. Click *Clone*.
.. Enter a name for the new profile that represents the use case, such as `External Developer`.
.. Assign permissions that match the member user profile permissions described in the API Community Manager documentation section xref:create-community.adoc#configure-member-user-profile-permissions[Configure Member User Profile Permissions].
. Configure your community to use the new profile:
.. Click *Setup* > *All Communities*.
.. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Community Administration* and click the *Members* tab.
.. In *Select Profiles*, use the search menu to select *Customer*.
.. Add the new *ACM Community User Plus* profile to the selected profiles.
.. Remove the existing *ACM Community User* profile but _do not_ remove the *System Administrator* profile.
+
If you remove the *System Administrator* profile, the system locks you out and removes all access to your community.
. Remove all profiles from your community sharing set:
.. Click *Setup* > *Communities Settings*.
.. In *Sharing Sets*, edit your community sharing set and remove all profiles from *Selected Profiles*.
.. If *Selected Objects* in the sharing set includes it, remove *CommunityApi*.
. If your community already has users, click *Setup* > *Users*, update each user to change *User License* to *Customer Community Plus*, and select the new *ACM Community User Plus* profile.
. In the API Community Manager control panel, set the visibility of each of your APIs to *Members Only*.

=== Define Member Groups

Use member groups, also known as _public groups_, to group members and then make individual APIs visible to the group. Visibility rules, also known as _sharing settings_, determine which APIs are visible to a member group.

To create a member group:

. Click *Setup* > *Public Groups*.
. Create a public group.
. Enter a name, such as `External Developers`.
. Click *Save*.

To add members to a member group:

. Click *Setup* > *Public Groups*.
. Edit the group.
. In the *Search* menu, select *Customer Portal Users*.
. Add the members by moving them from *Available Members* to *Selected Members*.
+
*Available Members* shows only users with the new *ACM Community User Plus* profile. If the user you want to add is not in *Available Members*, open the user record and verify the profile.
. Click *Save*.

=== Define Visibility Rules for APIs

Use visibility rules, also known as _sharing settings_, to define a set of conditions that determine which APIs are visible to a specific member group.

To create a new sharing set:

. Click *Setup* > *Sharing Settings*.
. In *Manage sharing settings for*, select *CommunityApi*.
. In *Sharing Rules*, click *New*.
. Enter a name for the rule.
. In *Select your rule type*, select *Based on Criteria*.
. Customize criteria using the available fields in the API, such as *Name* and *Visibility*.
+
Use *Add Filter Logic* to define and/or conditions.
. Select a member group to enable it to view the APIs matching these conditions.

In this example, an internal developer group sees publicly visible APIs and some internal APIs:

== Add Members to a Member Group

To add members to a member group:

. Click *Setup* > *Public Groups*.
. Edit the group.
. In *Search*, select *Customer Portal Users*.
. Add members to the group by moving them from *Available Members* to *Selected Members*.
+
*Available Members* shows only users with the new *ACM Community User Plus* profile. If the user you want to add is not in *Available Members*, open the user record and verify the profile.
. Click *Save*.

== Make an API Visible to a Member Group

To make an API visible to a member group:

. Click *Setup* > *Sharing Settings*.
. In *Manage sharing settings for*, select *CommunityApi*.
. In the *Sharing Rules* section, create a new rule or edit an existing rule.
. Ensure that the rule matches the API.
. Ensure that the rule specifies the member group.

== Automation

Assign users to member groups automatically with the option that best suits your needs:

* For simple automation such as adding each new user to a default member group, use Salesforce https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.process_overview.htm&type=5[Process Builder, role=external, window=blank].
* For complex automation by writing business rules for group assignment directly in APEX code, use https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers.htm[APEX triggers, role=external, window=blank].
* For complex automation by using declarative group assignment, use Salesforce https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.flow.htm&type=5[Flows, role=external, window=blank].
