Use Anypoint API Community Manager to create developer communities that surface APIs from Anypoint Platform
organizations in the MuleSoft AWS Government Cloud environment. In this deployment model, your developer community runs
on the standard API Community Manager product in the commercial cloud environment. Your community connects to your
MuleSoft Government Cloud organization as an external system to retrieve the specific information you want to make available
outside your FedRAMP authorization boundary for your public API community, such as API documentation.

In this model, you have full control of what data in your MuleSoft Government Cloud organization is
accessible to the API Community Manager product in the Salesforce commercial cloud environment. The MuleSoft Government Cloud data control
documentation page shows how to configure these detailed data access controls.

For compliance with FedRAMP regulations on handling support cases associated with API Community
Manager when connected to your MuleSoft Government Cloud organization, any support case that requires access or interaction
with your MuleSoft Government Cloud organization data is handled by the MuleSoft support team following FedRAMP requirements.
Support cases that do not require access to your MuleSoft Government Cloud data (such as those related to look and feel, branding, CMS articles, and
forums on your public developer community) are handled through API Community Manager standard support processes.
