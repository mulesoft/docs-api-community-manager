From the Anypoint API Community Manager control panel, open the Salesforce App Launcher and search for *API Community Manager Guided Setup*.

The following steps require a configured identity provider. For more information about configuring an identity provider, see xref:installation-prerequisites.adoc[Installation Prerequisites].

== Configure a Custom Subdomain

API Community Manager uses a custom subdomain to connect securely to your Anypoint organization.

This section of the guided setup helps you configure your subdomain, or displays the subdomain you have already configured.

== Connect with Your Anypoint Organization

To connect your API Community Manager instance to your Anypoint organization:

. Select your organization's Anypoint management plane.
+
This may be the US control plane, the EU control plane, the MuleSoft Government Cloud control plane, or another control plane.
. Create a connected app in your Anypoint organization for Salesforce to use as a consumer system.
+
If your Anypoint account has the organization administrator role, the guided setup tool can create the connected app for you.
+
Otherwise, create the connected app or ask an organization administrator to create it, then provide the app details so the guided setup can perform the authentication and authorization.
. Authenticate and authorize the connected app to access your Anypoint organization.
+
If your Anypoint account has the organization administrator role, provide your Anypoint Platform user and password, and the guided setup will create the app.
+
Otherwise, provide the app details.
+
The guided setup will authenticate and authorize the app to connect the API Community Manager organization with your Anypoint organization.

== User Configuration

Give your user the *Exchange Contributor* role:

. In your Anypoint Platform organization, click *Access Management* > *Users*.
. Select your user.
. Click *Role* > *Add role by name*.
. Add the role *Exchange Contributor*.

Map community user to Anypoint role:

. Ensure that you have Exchange Administrator permissions.
. In your Anypoint Platform organization, navigate to *Access Management* and click *Roles*.
. In *Exchange Viewers*, set a new External group called `Community User` and save it.

== Next Steps

After the connection with your Anypoint organization is established, click *Continue* to open the API Community Manager diagnostics tool to review your installation, then create your first community.
