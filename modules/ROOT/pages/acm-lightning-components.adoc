:imagesdir: ../assets/images/

You design the pages of your Anypoint API Community Manager portal by adding and configuring Lightning components in Community Builder.

These Lightning components include both the Lightning components available in all Salesforce Digital Experiences, and the API Community Manager Lightning components available only in API Community Manager.

Each API Community Manager Lightning component has different configuration options and adds different functionality to the portal.

Many API Community Manager Lightning components show data from Anypoint Platform. Community admins can change some of these data fields, such as API names, descriptions, and icons. API Community Manager saves these changes but does not push the changes back to Anypoint Platform.

[[acm-search-box]]
== ACM Search Box

The Anypoint API Community Manager Search Box component enables users to search for both content that exists in Salesforce Experience Cloud (such as knowledge articles, support cases, and announcements) and content that exists in Anypoint Platform (such as APIs and client applications). Results from the search are presented in the <<acm-search-results>> component.

You can specify values for the following parameters of the API Community Manager Search Box:

Result Page URL:: Specifies the URL of the search results page shown after the user enters a search.
Search Areas:: Selects which types of content to search: *APIs*, *API Groups*, *Applications*, *Knowledge Articles*, *Cases*, *Discussions*, *Topics*, *Managed Content (CMS)*, *API Specifications*, *Documentation Pages*, and *Custom Fields*.
Number of results to show:: Specifies the number of results shown as the user types a query.

The *Result Page URL* parameter specifies the URL of a search results page, and the search results page must include an *ACM Search Results* component to display the search results. If the page does not include an *ACM Search Results* component, members and guest users who enter a search and go to the page see no results.

If a content type is not selected in the *Search Areas* parameter, then the linked *ACM Search Results* component omits results of that content type. MuleSoft Government Cloud does not support searching in API specifications or documentation pages.

Your community's default pages have one ACM Search Box and one ACM Search Results component, and this is the best practice to minimize the chance of misconfigurations, although it is possible to use separate searches for separate audiences within your community's members.

Search results are sorted by the date they were most recently modified, from newest to oldest.

To test and preview the search configuration and the presentation of the results page, xref:preview-community.adoc[preview your API community] and run a search.

[[acm-search-results]]
== ACM Search Results

The API Community Manager Search Results component shows results after a user enters a search in the <<acm-search-box>> component.

You can specify values for the following parameters of the Search Results:

Component Title:: Specifies the title for the results.
Border:: Specifies border thickness. Values are *Thick*, *Medium*, *Thin*, or *None*. Default is *Thin*.
Show Search Input:: Shows the search input on the results page.

[[api-access-requester]]
== API Access Requester

The API Access Requester component enables community members to request access to an API for either a new or existing application.

An API page displays the *API Access Request* button when at least one API instance has its xref:exchange::to-configure-api-settings.adoc[visibility set to public in Exchange].

Community members can either request access for an existing client application and API instance, or request to create a new client application with access to the API by specifying the application name and description and choosing an API instance.

When a consumer developer requests access for a new client application to an API instance that has an identity provider (IDP), the consumer developer must specify one or more of the OAuth 2.0 grant types Authorization Code Grant, Implicit Grant, Refresh Token, and Resource Owner Grant. Some IDPs do not support all grant types. Requesting access and specifying an unsupported grant type shows the error `Error creating application.`

You can specify values for the following parameters of the API Access Requester:

API:: Specifies the API.
Button Border Radius:: Selects the button border radius. A larger radius makes the button look more rounded.
Button Align:: Specifies left, right, or center button alignment.
Show Modal Title Line:: Shows the title line in the access request modal.

== API Card

The API Card component shows information about an API or API Group, including icon, name, and description.

The icon, name, and description shown are set in the API Community Manager control panel when you xref:publish-apis.adoc[add an API or API Group version to your community].

You can specify values for the following parameters of the API Card:

API:: Specifies the API shown.
Override URL:: By default the API Details button links to the API main page. You can optionally set the Override URL to direct users to other information such as documentation or marketing collateral.

Show:: Specifies whether to show *APIs*, *Groups*, *APIs and Groups*, or *Children*. Default is *APIs and Groups*. *Children* shows the APIs in an API Group. Use the *Children* setting only on pages with *Page Variation* set to *API Group Detail* and not *API Detail*.
Filter Condition (Advanced):: Causes the carousel to show only APIs that match the given search condition, which uses the syntax described in <<filter-conditions>>.
Categories Filter (Advanced):: Causes the carousel to show only APIs that match the given categories, using the syntax described in <<categories-filter>>.
API Details Button Label:: Enables you to set the API Details button label. Default is *API Details*.
Learn More Button Label:: Enables you to set the Learn More button label. Default is *Learn More*.

[[api-catalog]]
== API Catalog

The API Catalog component offers API consumers an interactive way to explore all the available APIs and API Groups in an API community. The API Catalog shows API cards in rows and columns, divided into pages, and shows controls to filter the displayed APIs and API Groups by categories and search terms. Each card shows an API or API Group. With the catalog users can view and explore large numbers of API versions.

In the template community, the link to the API Catalog component appears below the API Carousel component. If a community has multiple API Catalog instances on multiple pages, the best practice is to standardize the pages and place the instances as consistently as possible.

To prevent confusion, the API Catalog component is designed to use a maximum of five managed categories, and not tags.

After you add a new category in Anypoint Exchange, it appears in the API Catalog configuration within five minutes when the cache refreshes automatically.

The API Catalog configuration shows a category only if at least one API has a value for that category.

If a category is removed or modified in Exchange, all API Catalog instances automatically reflect the change.

A card can have multiple badges from one category. It can display up to three badges and, if it has more, it offers a tooltip to display them.

If you do not specify category colors, your community theme is used as the default. Colors can be hexadecimal values such as `#FF0000` or `#0000FF` or standard CSS color names such as `red` and `blue`.

You can use URL parameters to pass filters to the catalog. For example, the URL of the page with the catalog component can end with `?catalogFilters=Country:Argentina,USA;Payment:Cash,Credit`.

The API icon, name, and description shown are set in the API Community Manager control panel when you xref:publish-apis.adoc[add an API version to your community].

You can specify values for the following parameters of the API Catalog component:

Component Title:: Specifies the catalog title. Default is *API Catalog*.
Show API Counter:: Enables you to show the API counter, which displays the number of APIs that match the current search and filters.
APIs Per Page:: Specifies the number of APIs shown on each page of the catalog. Default is 12.
Category Filter 1 through Category Filter 5:: Specifies the categories that community members and guest users can use to filter the APIs. Default is *None*.
Category Color 1 through Category Color 5:: Specifies the color for each category.
Search Input Position:: Specifies whether the search box is next to the filters or below the filters and above the cards.
Category Card Badge 1 through Category Card Badge 3:: Specifies the categories that appear at the top of the cards as badges, with colors matching the category colors.
Show:: Specifies whether to show *APIs*, *Groups*, *APIs and Groups*, or *Children*. Default is *APIs and Groups*. *Children* shows the APIs in an API Group. Use the *Children* setting only on pages with *Page Variation* set to *API Group Detail* and not *API Detail*.
Filter Condition (Advanced):: Causes the catalog to show only APIs that match the given search condition, which uses the syntax described in <<filter-conditions>>.
Categories Filter (Advanced):: Causes the catalog to show only APIs that match the given categories, using the syntax described in <<categories-filter>>.

[[api-console]]
== API Console

The interactive API Console component shows information about your APIs and their methods, and enables users to test the methods by sending requests.

Endpoints are displayed in alphabetical order.

Console components include API Console, API Console Documentation, API Console Instances, API Console Navigation, and API Console Request Panel. In Community Builder, you can add multiple console components to the same page. Changes to a console component are visible in all other console components on that page that display the same API. For example, selecting the *Summary* tab in an API Console results in *Summary* tab selection in all API Consoles on the same page that display the same API.

The component shows the API instances and documentation from xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange].

If an API's specification includes OAuth 2.0 security, users either select a client application in the *Credentials source* list to populate the client ID and client secret automatically, or they select *Custom credentials* in the list to enter the client ID and client secret manually.

image::credentials-source.png[Credentials source]

By default, the API console sends requests of 2 megabytes or less from the browser through Salesforce Experience Cloud to an API. To send requests directly from the browser to an API instance, which allows requests with no size limit, open *Setup* > *Custom Metadata Type* > *ACM API Console Configuration Metadata* > *Manage ACM API Console Configuration Metadata* > *ACM API Console Configuration* > *Edit* and select *Browser Requests Enabled*. This setting applies to all API instances in the community and does not affect the mocking service.

You can specify values for the following parameters of the API console:

API:: Specifies the API to display.
Show Documentation Pages:: Shows the API's documentation pages.

If an *API Console* navigation item such as an API endpoint or method has a long name, the name wraps around to a second line. By default, the line breaks at the end of a word, using the `word-break` CSS property set to the value `break-word`. If you wish to select different line break behavior:

. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Community Builder* > *Settings* > *Advanced*.
. In the section *Head Markup*, click *Edit Head Markup*.
. Insert this code:
+
[source,css]
----
<style>
    api-navigation {
      --api-navigation-list-item-word-break: break-word !important;
    }
</style>
----
. Optionally, replace `api-navigation` with any selector that contains the component `api-navigation`.
. Optionally, replace `break-word` with any valid value for the `word-break` CSS property.

To link directly to an endpoint or type in this component, set the URL query paramters `method`, `path`, or `type`. `method` must be in lower case. `type` is case sensitive. If `method` and `path` are defined and exist in the API definition, then navigation will open there regardless of the `type` parameter. If `method` or `path` is not defined and `type` is defined and exists in the API definition, then navigation will open at the specified `type`. Examples:

* `communityapi/a003D000001pQpjQAE/basicapi?method=get&path=/users/{id}`

* `+NavigateUrl != ''+`: The API has a Learn More button that links to a custom page with more information.
* `+VersionGroup = 'v2'+`: The API version group is exactly equal to `v2`.
* `+VersionGroup > 'v1'+`: The API version group is later than `v1`.
* `+VersionGroup < 'v1'+`: The API version group is earlier than `v1`.
* `+VersionGroup >= 'v2'+`: The API version group is later than or equal to `v2`.
* `+VersionGroup <= 'v2'+`: The API version group is earlier than or equal to `v2`.

Queries using `OR` or `AND` must enclose the whole condition in parentheses.

API Community Manager compares version groups using normal string comparison.

You can learn more about SOQL from the Salesforce SOQL and SOSL Reference.

[[categories-filter]]
== Categories Filter

The API Carousel component and the API Catalog component use the parameter *Categories Filter (Advanced)* to show only the APIs that have categories in Anypoint Exchange with the specified values.

Write categories and values as semicolon-separated pairs such as `Country=Argentina;Payment=Credit`. Use commas to separate multiple values for the same category such as `Country=Argentina,Spain;Payment=Credit`.

The API Carousel or API Catalog will show only APIs that match all of the category-value pairs in the categories filter and all of the filter conditions.
