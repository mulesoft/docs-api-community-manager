== Pages

Select the *Pages* icon, which resembles a bulleted list, in the top left navigation to display the name of the current
page or select another page in the community to view and edit. The *Pages* menu also offers a *New Page* option.

A new page can be an *Object Page* or *Standard Page*. An *Object Page* is only used with Salesforce objects,
so use *Standard Page* when creating your custom community pages. You can start your standard page by choosing one of the preconfigured pages or making a *New Blank Page*.

To make a new blank page, select the layout, then enter the new page's *Name* and *URL*. Use the URL to make
links to the new page, including links in menus.

The new page is displayed with placeholders for content based on the layout.

Add your components, such as a *Headline* component in the page header, or an ACM Lightning component
such as an *ACM API Version Carousel*.

The *Pages* menu also shows the editable configuration properties for each page, which are described
