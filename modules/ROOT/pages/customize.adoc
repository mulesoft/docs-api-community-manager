https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_designer_overview.htm&type=5[Experience Builder, role=external, window=blank] enables
you to create a Salesforce Experience Cloud site with your desired brand identity, look and feel, and
site structure by providing control over the site's components, themes,
and pages, and its settings for general properties, themes, and SEO.

In the Anypoint API Community Manager control panel, the *Community Builder* link
opens your site for editing. With Community Builder you can edit each page in
your community, create new pages, and add and edit the components in each page.

Community Builder's interface contains the pages list, component palette,
theme menu, page structure menu, and settings menu.

== Pages List

The *Pages* list shows the pages included with API Community Manager and the pages you have added,
and enables you to select and edit each page. The included page *Home* is
selected by default.

The *Pages* list enables you to create new pages by using the *New Page* option.

A new page can be an object page or a standard page. Object pages are used
only with Salesforce objects, so a custom community page starts as a
standard page. A standard page can start from one of the preconfigured pages
or as a new blank page.

Make a new blank page by selecting the layout and then entering the new page's
name and URL. Use that URL to make links to the new page, including links in
menus.

The new page displays with placeholders for content based on the layout.

Fill in a new page by adding components from the *Components* menu, such
as a Headline component in the page header, or an API Community Manager Lightning component
such as an API Version Carousel.

The *Pages* list shows the editable configuration properties for each page,
which are described in https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_builder_manage_pages_overview.htm&type=5[Manage Your Community's Pages and Their Properties in Experience Builder, role=external, window=blank].

== Components

Clicking the *Components* lightning bolt icon displays the component palette,
which includes Salesforce Experience Cloud components, such as Headline or
Featured Topics, and components specific to API Community Manager, such as API Carousel or API
Console. You can drag any component from the component palette to the current
page. Select the component on the page to show the component's configuration
options.
