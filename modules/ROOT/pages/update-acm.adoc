Keep your Anypoint API Community Manager instance up to date to take advantage of new and improved functionality in your community.

For information about updates, see xref:notifications.adoc[Important Notifications].

After you install an update with this process, it is not possible to undo the installation and return to a previous version. Follow the best-practice workflow by creating safe sandbox environments and using them to test each update before installing the update in your production environment.

== Sandboxes

Best-practice workflow:

. Keep a partial copy sandbox or a full copy sandbox as a long-term staging environment.
+
The staging environment will have a partial or full copy of the data in the production environment.
. Create a short-term developer sandbox.
. Install the update in the developer sandbox and test it.
. Discard the developer sandbox.
. Install the update in the staging sandbox and test it.
. Install the update in your production environment.

To create a new sandbox:

. In *Setup*, search for *Sandboxes* using the *Quick Find* box and click *New Sandbox*.
. Enter a name and description and create a new developer sandbox.
. After several minutes to a few hours, sandbox creation completes and sends you a notification email.
. In *Setup*, search for *Sandboxes* using the *Quick Find* box and log in to your new sandbox.
.. Note that the user name has the sandbox name as a suffix.
.. Enter your administrator password.
. Validate the sandbox:
.. Open the application launcher.
.. Open the *API Community Manager* application.
.. Publish a few APIs.
.. Open the builder.
.. Publish your community.
.. Open your community's live site.
.. Validate the site is operational.

After validating your sandbox, begin the update.

== Update Steps

To update your API community:

. Before performing any steps, read all the steps, including pre-install and post-install.
. If necessary, notify your customers and stakeholders of the update, and that APIs, docs, and client app pages may not work during the update during the time after installing the new package and before completing the required configuration changes.
. Ensure that your Salesforce organizations have the External Data Change Tracking for OData 4.0 Adapter feature enabled:
.. Before upgrading the package in your production or sandbox organization, check that your organization has this feature enabled by going to *Setup* > *External Data Source* and editing the Exchange data source.
.. If you don't see an *Eligible for External Change Data Capture* checkbox, raise a support case through the MuleSoft support portal and list the IDs of all your Salesforce API Community Manager organizations, including the IDs of all production and sandbox organizations.
+
Attempting to upgrade the package without this feature enabled causes the process to fail with errors due to missing objects and fields related to a missing ChangeEvent object.
. Open the API Community Manager control panel.
. In the same browser session, open the *package update installation link* provided by your MuleSoft representative.
. Verify the version number and name of the release.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.26, follow the <<pre-126>> and then continue with these instructions.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.74, follow the <<pre-174>> and then continue with these instructions.
. Select *Install for admins only*.
. Select *Upgrade*.
+
This starts the installation process.
+
When the upgrade finishes, you receive a notification email.
. If you are upgrading from package version 1.62 or earlier, follow the <<post-162>> and then continue with these instructions.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.69, follow the <<post-169>> and then continue with these instructions.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.74, follow the <<post-174>> and then continue with these instructions.
. If you are upgrading from a package version before 1.77, follow the <<post-177>>.
