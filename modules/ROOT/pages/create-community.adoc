Creating and configuring a community includes setting branding, forums and moderation rules, Salesforce CMS, Salesforce CRM content, Chatter tracking for APIs, profiles and permissions, sharing, member registration and approval, and user impersonation.

You can create any number of communities. All communities are in the same Salesforce organization. The default Anypoint API Community Manager license covers up to 100 communities.

Installing, updating, or configuring API Community Manager must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the API Community Manager Salesforce organization.

If you are not familiar with Communities, refer to the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_resources.htm&type=5[Salesforce Communities Overview, role=external, window=_blank].

== Create a New Community

. Navigate to *Setup*.
. In the *Quick Find* box, enter *`All Communities`* and then click *All Communities*.
. Click *New Community*.
+
All communities templates are listed.
. If you want to get started from an example, choose any of the *API Community Manager Templates* or any of the other available templates.
. If you want to design your community from scratch with full control of the structure and look and feel, choose *Build your own*.
. Click *Get Started*.
. Enter values for *Name* and *optional URL suffix* for your community.
. Click *Create*.
+
The configuration process will take a few minutes.
+
. When the configuration process finishes and you see your new community workspace, click *Install AppExchange Package* in the top banner and follow the installation wizard instructions to install the pre-defined metrics and dashboards.
+
Be sure to install this package in your production organization when prompted by the wizard.
. In *Application Launcher*, navigate to *ACM Administrator*, click *Community Administration*, go to the *Settings* section, and click *Activate Community*.

To enable the admin panels, publish your community for the first time:

. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Community Builder*.
. Click *Publish* in the top right corner.
. In the *Publish Your Community* dialog, click *Publish*.
+
In a few minutes, your community is published.
. Look for an email notification including your community's public URL.
. You can also always find your community's live URL by opening the API Community Manager control panel and clicking *Open Community*.

To use a custom domain name, also known as a vanity domain, refer to the Salesforce knowledge article https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000336819&type=1&mode=1[Run your Salesforce Community under a custom domain, role=external, window=_blank].

To customize the look, feel, and branding of your community, refer to xref:brand-intro.adoc[Brand and Customize Your API Community].

== Optionally Set Up an Admin Approval Process for Creating New Users

Use these steps to set an optional approval process for self-registered users. The system will then require administrator approval before creating member accounts. If the request is approved, the new user account is created, a welcome email is sent to the new user, and the user sets a password and logs in to the community.

If you don't configure an approval process, self-registered users will become members automatically when they register.

Create the approval process:

. In *Setup*, search for *Approval Processes* in the *Quick Find* box and click *Approval Processes*.
. In the *Manage Approval Processes For* list, select *Self Register User Request*.
. In the *Create New Approval Process* list, select *Use Standard Setup Wizard*.

.. Click *Next*.

.. In *Step 4. Select Notification Templates*, in the *Approval Assignment Email Template* section, in the look-up dialog, under the *ACM* category, select *Registration Request*.
.. Click *Next*.

.. In *Step 5. Select Fields to Display on Approval Page Layout*:
... Add *Self Register User Request Name* and *Owner* to *Selected Fields*.
... Select the *Display approval history information in addition to the fields selected above* check box.
.. Click *Next*.

.. In *Step 6. Specify Initial Submitters*, add *Self Register User Request Owner* to the *Allowed Submitters* column.
.. Click *Save* and continue to the next section.

Create an approval step:

. If you are prompted to add an approval step, click *Yes, I'd like to create an approval step now* and click *Go!*.
. If you are not prompted to add an approval step:
.. In *Setup*, search for *Approval Processes* in the *Quick Find* box and click *Approval Processes*.
.. Click *Approve Registration* (the approval that you created in the previous section).
.. In the *Approval Steps* section, click *New Approval Step*.

. In the *Step 1. Enter Name and Description* section, enter `Step 1` in *Name*.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Step 2. Specify Step Criteria* section, click *Next*.
. In the *Step 3. Select Assigned Approver* section, select *Let the submitter choose the approver manually*.
. Click *Save*.

Create a final approval action:

. If you are prompted to add an Approval Action, click *Yes, I'd like to create an approval action for this step now*, select *Field Update* in the list, and click *Go!*.
. If you are not prompted to add an Approval Action:
.. In *Setup*, search for *Approval Processes* in the *Quick Find* box and click *Approval Processes*.
.. On the *Self Register User Request: Approve Registration* page, navigate to *Final Approval Actions* and click *Add New*.
.. Click *Field Update*.

. In the *Field Update Edit* section, enter these values.
.. *Name*: `Create User`
.. *Field to update*: `Approved`
.. *Re-evaluate Workflow Rules after Field Change*: Select the check box.
.. *Checkbox Options*: `True`.

. Click *Save*.

Activate the approval process:

. On the *Approve Registration* page, click *Activate* and confirm.
. In the API Community Manager control panel, open *Community Builder* and click *Settings* > *General*.
. In Community Builder, navigate to the *Register* page in the *Pages* list and select the API Community Manager *Self Register* Lightning component.
. Verify the *Approved Registration* and set the *Approver Id* with the *User Id* of the user you want to approve the registration requests.

To get the *User Id*:

. Navigate to Salesforce Setup.
. Search for `Users` in the *Quick Find* box and click *Users*.
. Select the user who you want to be the approver.
. The ID is contained in the URL of the User detail page you are currently
viewing. Remove the first 2 characters and paste the remaining information in
the *Approver Id* field. For example, if the unique ID is `2F0052D000001QpG1`,
paste `0052D000001QpG1` in the *Approver Id* field.

== Configure Impersonation

Impersonation links each community member to an Anypoint user. This connects the
Anypoint and community users and their client applications, so that applications are
created under the correct user, and actions in audit logs are recorded accurately.

Impersonation uses SAML, and it requires an Identity Provider (IdP) to be configured in both Anypoint Platform and Salesforce organizations. You can use Salesforce as an IdP, as described here.

Configure Salesforce as a SAML IdP:

. In *Setup*, search for *App Manager* using the *Quick Find* box and click *App Manager*.
. Click *New Connected App* in the top right.
. Provide this information in the *Basic Information* section.
.. *Connected App Name*: `Anypoint`.
.. *Contact Email*: Enter your email address.
. Provide this information in the *Web App Settings* section.
.. Provide the *Start URL*: `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/<your_anypoint_domain_name>+` or the location
where you want users to be sent in Anypoint Platform. You can find your Anypoint organization domain name by clicking *Access Management* -> *Organization* and then selecting the root organization.
.. Select *Enable SAML*.
.. Provide any string as *Entity Id*. This is also the *Audience* configuration in Anypoint Platform.
.. Provide `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/receive-id+` in the *ACS URL*. SAML assertions are sent to this ACS URL.
.. Select *Enable Single Logout*.
.. Provide *Single Logout URL*: `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/logout/receive-id+`.
.. Set *Single Logout Binding* to *HTTP Post*.
.. Set *Subject Type* to *Username*.
.. Set *Name ID* Format to *unspecified nameID format*.
.. Set *Issuer* to *salesforce_org_domainname* (such as `+https://[YourOrgDomain].my.salesforce.com+`).
.. Set *IdP Certificate* to *Default IdP Certificate*.
.. Click *Save*.

By default, Salesforce does not send first name and last name attributes of users, so you must add them explicitly as custom attributes:

. In your connected app screen, click *Manage*.
. Scroll to *Custom Attributes*.
. Add the first name attribute.
.. Click *New*.
.. Type `firstname` in the *Attribute key* field.
.. Click *Insert Field*.
.. Click *$User >* -> *First Name* -> *Insert* -> *Save*.
. Add the last name attribute.
.. Click *New*.
.. Type `lastname` in the *Attribute key* field.
.. Click *Insert Field*.
.. Click *$User >* -> *Last Name* -> *Insert* -> *Save*.

Configure external identity in your Anypoint organization.

In your connected app screen, click *Manage*. Make a note of the URIs under the *SAML Login Information* to use them in the Anypoint configuration in these steps.

Also, click *Download metadata* and retrieve the public key in the `<ds:X509Certificate>` tag inside the XML file.

. Log in to your Anypoint organization.
. Navigate to *Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Identity Management* -> *SAML 2.0*.
. Set *Sign On URL* to *IdP-Initiated Login URL*.
. Set *Sign Off URL* to *Single Logout Endpoint*.
. Set *Issuer* to match the Salesforce account: `salesforce_org_domainname`.
. Set the *Public Key* to the public key extracted from the `<ds:X509Certificate>` tag in the metadata XML you downloaded.
. Set *Audience* to match the *Entity Id* you set in the Salesforce account.
. Select *Enable new non-SSO users*.
. Click *Save*.

Configure and authorize the OData bridge to perform impersonation.

This requires a private key or a certificate, and a keystore (JKS) containing that key or certificate.
Use the same certificate that Salesforce IdP uses.

. In *Salesforce Setup*, search for *Certificate and Key Management* using the *Quick Find* box and click *Certificate and Key Management*.
. Click *Export to Keystore* in the *Certificates* section.
. Enter a new Password.
. Click *Export*.

. Log in to your Anypoint organization
. Go to *Access Management* -> *Environments*, click *Add Environment* and provide this information.
.. Set *Environment Name* to `ACM`.
.. Click *Production*.
.. Click *Create*.
. Go to *Users* and open your user.
.. Click *Secrets Manager*.
.. Set *Environment* to the newly created environment `ACM`.
.. Select all permissions in *Permissions*.
.. Click the plus button.
. To apply these changes, log out and then log back in.

. Go to *Secrets Manager* and select the `ACM` environment using the environment switcher. 
. Click *Create Secret Group* and enter this information.
.. Set *Name* to *Certificates*.
.. Click *Secret Group Downloadable*.
.. Click *Save*.
.. Click *Keystore*.
.. Click *Add Keystore*.
.. Provide this information.
... *Name*: Enter `Impersonation`.
... *Type*: Enter the type of your keystore, which is typically JKS.
... *Keystore File*: Choose your keystore file, which is typically the file you exported from Salesforce.
... *Keystore Passphrase*: Enter the exported Keystore.
... *Alias*: Choose the corresponding alias to your key or certificate.
... *Key Passphrase*: Create a new Passphrase.
... Click *Save*.
.. Click *Secret Groups*, click *Finish* on the recently created secret group, and confirm the operation.

For detailed information about creating secret groups and adding certificates, refer to
https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-security/asm-secret-group-creation-task#create-a-secret-group[Create a Secret Group (Anypoint Platform), role=external, window=_blank].

Map community user to Anypoint role:

. In your Anypoint Platform organization, navigate to *Access Management* and click *Roles*.
. In *Exchange Viewers*, set a new External group called `Community User` and save it.

*IMPORTANT*: If you choose to use another key or certificate for the impersonation feature,
you must add this key in the External Identity configuration on Anypoint Platform, as shown in these steps.

. In Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Edit*.
. Add your key in *Public Key*.
.. Copy the key with no line breaks.
.. After the key displayed in the *Public Key* field, add a comma (`,`) and then paste in the new key.
.. Click *Save*.

Reauthenticate the data bridge as described in xref:data-bridge.adoc#authenticate-data-bridge[Authenticate the Data Bridge].
