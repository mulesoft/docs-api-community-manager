Creating and configuring a Salesforce Experience Cloud site for your API community includes setting branding, forums and moderation rules, Salesforce CMS, Salesforce CRM content, Chatter tracking for APIs, profiles and permissions, sharing, member registration and approval, and user impersonation.

You can create any number of sites. All sites are in the same Salesforce organization. The default Anypoint API Community Manager license covers up to 100 sites.

Installing, updating, or configuring API Community Manager must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the API Community Manager Salesforce organization.

If you are not familiar with Experience Cloud, refer to the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.networks_resources.htm&type=5[Experience Cloud Overview, role=external, window=_blank].

== Create a New Community

. Navigate to *Setup*.
. In the *Quick Find* box, enter *`Digital Experiences`* and then click *All Sites*.
. Click *New*.
+
All site templates are listed.
. If you want to get started from an example, choose any of the *API Community Manager Templates* or any of the other available templates.
. If you want to design your site from scratch with full control of the structure and look and feel, choose *Build your own*.
. Click *Get Started*.
. Enter values for *Name* and *optional URL suffix* for your site.
. Click *Create*.
+
The configuration process will take a few minutes.
+
. When the configuration process finishes and you see your new site workspace, click *Install AppExchange Package* in the top banner and follow the installation wizard instructions to install the pre-defined metrics and dashboards.
+
Be sure to install this package in your production organization when prompted by the wizard.
. In *Application Launcher*, navigate to *ACM Administrator*, click *Community Administration*, go to the *Settings* section, and click *Activate Community*.

To enable the admin panels, publish your community for the first time:

. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Community Builder*.
. Click *Publish* in the top right corner.
. In the *Publish Your Community* dialog, click *Publish*.
+
In a few minutes, your community is published.
. Look for an email notification including your community's public URL.
. You can also always find your community's live URL by opening the API Community Manager control panel and clicking *Open Community*.

To use a custom domain name, also known as a vanity domain, refer to the Salesforce knowledge article https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000336819&type=1&mode=1[Run your Salesforce Digital Experience under a custom domain, role=external, window=_blank].

To customize the look, feel, and branding of your community, refer to xref:brand-intro.adoc[Brand and Customize Your API Community].

== Configure Content

Your community's content configuration controls the forums, moderation rules, Chatter tracking for APIs, Salesforce CMS, and Salesforce CRM content.

=== Configure Forums

. In the *Application Launcher* navigate to *ACM Administrator*, click *Community Administration*, and click *Preferences* in the left panel.

. Click *Save*.
. Return to the API Community Manager control panel, and click *Manage CMS Content*.
. Click the *Topics* tab.
. Click *Navigational Topics*.
. Create as many topics as you need for your community forums and click *Save*.

By default, discussion forums are not moderated, so any member can create posts with any content and the posts become visible for other members immediately. If you want to define a basic "review/approve-all" moderation model, follow these steps:

. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Manage Forums* > *Rules*.
. Click *New* and create a *Content Rule*.
