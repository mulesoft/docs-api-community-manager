Creating and configuring a community includes setting branding, forums and moderation rules, Salesforce CMS, Salesforce CRM content, Chatter tracking for APIs, profiles and permissions, sharing, member registration and approval, and user impersonation.

You can create any number of communities. All communities are in the same Salesforce organization. The default Anypoint API Community Manager license covers up to 100 communities.

Installing, updating, or configuring API Community Manager must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the API Community Manager Salesforce organization.

If you are not familiar with Communities, refer to the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_resources.htm&type=5[Salesforce Communities Overview, role=external, window=_blank].

== Create a New Community

. Navigate to *Setup*.
. In the *Quick Find* box, enter *`All Communities`* and then click *All Communities*.
. Click *New Community*.
+
All communities templates are listed.
. If you want to get started from an example, choose any of the *API Community Manager Templates* or any of the other available templates.
. If you want to design your community from scratch with full control of the structure and look and feel, choose *Build your own*.
. Click *Get Started*.
. Enter values for *Name* and *optional URL suffix* for your community.
. Click *Create*.
+
The configuration process will take a few minutes.
+
. When the configuration process finishes and you see your new community workspace, click *Install AppExchange Package* in the top banner and follow the installation wizard instructions to install the pre-defined metrics and dashboards.
+
Be sure to install this package in your production organization when prompted by the wizard.
. In *Application Launcher*, navigate to *ACM Administrator*, click *Community Administration*, go to the *Settings* section, and click *Activate Community*.

To enable the admin panels, publish your community for the first time:

. In the API Community Manager control panel, click *Community Builder*.
. Click *Publish* in the top right corner.
. In the *Publish Your Community* dialog, click *Publish*.
+
In a few minutes, your community is published.
. Look for an email notification including your community's public URL.
. You can also always find your community's live URL by opening the API Community Manager control panel and clicking *Open Community*.

To use a custom domain name, also known as a vanity domain, refer to the Salesforce knowledge article https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000336819&type=1&mode=1[Run your Salesforce Community under a custom domain, role=external, window=_blank].

To customize the look, feel, and branding of your community, refer to xref:brand-intro.adoc[Brand and Customize Your API Community].

== Optionally Set Up an Admin Approval Process for Creating New Users

Use these steps to set an optional approval process for self-registered users. The system will then require administrator approval before creating member accounts. If the request is approved, the new user account is created, a welcome email is sent to the new user, and the user sets a password and logs in to the community.

.. Click *Save* and continue to the next section.

Create an approval step:

. If you are prompted to add an approval step, click *Yes, I'd like to create an approval step now* and click *Go!*.
. If you are not prompted to add an approval step:
.. In *Setup*, search for *Approval Processes* in the *Quick Find* box and click *Approval Processes*.
.. Click *Approve Registration* (the approval that you created in the previous section).
.. In the *Approval Steps* section, click *New Approval Step*.

. Click *Next*.
. In the *Step 2. Specify Step Criteria* section, click *Next*.
. In the *Step 3. Select Assigned Approver* section, select *Let the submitter choose the approver manually*.
. Click *Save*.

Create a final approval action:

. If you are prompted to add an Approval Action, click *Yes, I'd like to create an approval action for this step now*, select *Field Update* in the list, and click *Go!*.
. If you are not prompted to add an Approval Action:

.. *Checkbox Options*: `True`.

. Click *Save*.

Activate the approval process:

. On the *Approve Registration* page, click *Activate* and confirm.
. In the API Community Manager control panel, open *Community Builder* and click *Settings* > *General*.
. In Community Builder, navigate to the *Register* page in the *Pages* list and select the API Community Manager *Self Register* Lightning component.
. Verify the *Approved Registration* and set the *Approver Id* with the *User Id* of the user you want to approve the registration requests.

To get the *User Id*:

. Navigate to Salesforce Setup.
. Search for `Users` in the *Quick Find* box and click *Users*.
. Select the user who you want to be the approver.
. The ID is contained in the URL of the User detail page you are currently
viewing. Remove the first 2 characters and paste the remaining information in
the *Approver Id* field. For example, if the unique ID is `2F0052D000001QpG1`,
paste `0052D000001QpG1` in the *Approver Id* field.
