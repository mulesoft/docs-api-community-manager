= Broken Images on Documentation Pages

If your community shows a broken image on an API documentation page, and the image displays correctly on the API documentation page in Exchange, follow these steps:

. Images uploaded to Exchange with the markdown editor are stored in Exchange.
. If the image is stored in Exchange, make the Exchange API version asset public so the image can be rendered in your community.
. If the image is stored on a web location outside Exchange, such as S3 or Dropbox:
.. Open Salesforce setup.
.. Open your community's content security policy (CSP) trusted sites list.
.. Ensure that the list includes the image site domain.
.. Because some file-sharing services resolve URLs through multiple redirects, ensure that the list includes the domain of the final URL.

To learn if any content in any component or page of the community is blocked by the content security policy:

. Open the API Community Manager control panel.
. Click *Community Builder*.
. Click *Preview*.
. Open the page that contains the content.

To inspect the URLs the browser loads when rendering a community page, use the browser developer tools.
