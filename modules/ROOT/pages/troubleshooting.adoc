If you encounter errors while you are using Anypoint API Community Manager, refer to these explanations and instructions for recovery.

== Approved Members Not Created or Emailed

If your Winter '20 Salesforce organization has the member approval workflow active, and approving a member and refreshing the screen removes the member from the list without creating the new user or sending the new user email, troubleshoot by either setting the approver's language to English or adding the approver's language.

To set the approver's language to English, configure the approver user in the `SelfRegister` component and set the locale to English.

To add the approver's language:

. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open company settings.
. Open language settings.
. Enable the appropriate languages and locales by enabling end-user languages, enabling platform-only languages, or both.
. Add the language matching the approver user profile to the list of displayed languages.

== Not Authorized or Problem Logging In Error When Saving External Data Source Configuration

If saving the external data source configuration shows one of the errors "Not authorized" or "Problem Logging In - No_Oauth_State: State was not sent back", follow these steps:

. Ensure that the connected app domain is the right domain of the Salesforce organization.
. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open the authentication providers configuration.
. Click the name of the Anypoint Platform authentication provider and ensure that it has these settings from the correct connected app in Anypoint Platform:
.. Ensure that the consumer key and consumer secret match the connected app in Anypoint Platform.
.. Ensure that the authorize endpoint URL, token endpoint URL, and default scopes are configured as described in xref:data-bridge.adoc#create-auth-provider[Create an Authentication Provider in Your Salesforce Organization].
.. Ensure that the test-only initialization URL, OAuth-only initialization URL, callback URL, and single logout URL match the correct domain of your Salesforce organization.
.. Ensure that your connected app in Anypoint Platform has the same domain as your Salesforce organization in its `redirect_uri` setting, a client ID and client secret that match those in Salesforce, and correct scopes.

To view details of the connected app, examine the UI or make this API call:

----
curl -X GET 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/connectedApplications/' \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "authorization: bearer XXXXXXXXX"
----

This call returns a response like this:

---- 
{
"client_id": "5fafXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX29c9",
"client_secret": "9509XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC10E",
"client_name": "ACM Integration Client",
"redirect_uris": [
  "https://YourOrgDomain.my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"
],
"grant_types": [
  "authorization_code",
  "refresh_token"
],
"public_keys": [],
"scopes": [
  "offline_access",
  "full"
],
"enabled": true,
"owner_org_id": "f377XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX9d08",
"as_id": "anypoint"
}
----

"YourOrgDomain" is replaced by your organization domain.

== Missing Request Access Button

If a published API version is not showing the *Request access* button:

. Ensure that the API version is managed in API Manager.
. If it is not, click *Import from Exchange*.
. Ensure that the API version has at least one endpoint defined.
. Label the endpoint.
. This label displays in your community.
. Ensure that at least one of the API version's endpoints is configured as public in Exchange.

In the community builder, check the audience targeting settings of the xref:acm-lightning-components.adoc#api-access-requester[API Access Requester] Lightning component. To make the API Access Requester appear to all members, ensure that it is not assigned to any audience. To make it appear only to a specific audience, ensure that it is assigned to the correct audience, and verify it by viewing the page while logged in to an account that is a member of this audience.

== Broken Images on Documentation Pages

If your community shows a broken image on an API documentation page, and the image displays correctly on the API documentation page in Exchange, follow these steps:

. Images uploaded to Exchange with the markdown editor are stored in Exchange.
. If the image is stored in Exchange, make the Exchange API version asset public so the image can be rendered in your community.
. If the image is stored on a web location outside Exchange, such as S3 or Dropbox:
.. Open Salesforce setup.
.. Open your community's content security policy (CSP) trusted sites list.
.. Ensure that the list includes the image site domain.
.. Because some file-sharing services resolve URLs through multiple redirects, ensure that the list includes the domain of the final URL.

To learn if any content in any component or page of the community is blocked by the content security policy:

. Open the API Community Manager control panel.
. Click *Community Builder*.
. Click *Preview*.
. Open the page that contains the content.

To inspect the URLs the browser loads when rendering a community page, use the browser developer tools.

== Console Mocking Service Not Loading

If the console shows a spinning icon and never loads the mocking service:

. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open the *Named Credentials* configuration.
. Ensure that the Anypoint Platform credentials are configured as described in xref:data-bridge.adoc#authenticate-data-bridge[Authenticate the Data Bridge].
. Ensure that the mocking service uses HTTPS.

== Unauthorized Endpoint Error

If calling a real endpoint from the console shows an *Unauthorized Endpoint* error:

. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open your community's content security policy (CSP) trusted sites list.
. Ensure that the list includes the endpoint site domain.

The console works in the user's browser and can call only trusted endpoint sites.

== Incorrect or Missing Data for One API Version

If a single API version has documentation or console components with incorrect or missing data:

. Open the API Community Manager control panel.
. Edit the API version.
. Click *View asset in Exchange*.
. Ensure that the API version in API Community Manager points to the correct API version in Exchange.
. Ensure that the API version in Exchange is published and not in draft mode.

== Guest Users Not Seeing Published API Versions

If guest users do not see published API versions that have been set to be visible for everyone:

. Open Salesforce setup.
. Open the sharing rules.
. Ensure that the sharing rule for the object `CommunityApi` matches your community name exactly, including spacing and letter case.

== Refresh the Cache

If changes made to APIs are not visible right after you make them, you can refresh the cache to see them:

. Log in to your Salesforce organization.
. In *Setup*, click *Platform Cache*.
. Click the `ACMCache` partition.
. If the caches are in use, then the *Clear Cache* button is displayed.
. Click *Clear Cache*.
