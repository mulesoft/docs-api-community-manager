These pages explain how to publish APIs and content to your Anypoint API
Community Manager community and how to manage forums, members, and support cases.

In an API Community, APIs and API documentation are published from Anypoint Exchange, and articles are published from the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_managed_content_overview.htm&type=5[Salesforce content management system (CMS), role=external, window=blank].

API documentation in Exchange includes detailed descriptions of each API version.
This documentation is updated with the API release cycle, usually with close
involvement from the development team.

Salesforce CMS articles include event, marketing, and vision information. These
articles typically have their own release cycle and process, usually with close
involvement from the marketing team.

All of these actions are performed in the API Community Manager control panel:

To open the API Community Manager control panel at any time, open the Salesforce *App Launcher* and select *API Community Manager*.
