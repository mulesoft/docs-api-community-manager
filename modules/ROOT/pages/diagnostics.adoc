From the Anypoint API Community Manager control panel, open the Salesforce App Launcher and search for *API Community Manager Diagnostics*.

== Status Tab

The status tab shows the status of your Salesforce organization and your communities.

The *Organization* section shows this information about your Salesforce organization:

. *Package version* shows the version of your currently installed API Community Manager package.
. *Connectivity with Anypoint* shows the URL your API community uses to access Anypoint.
. *Cache*:
.. *Org cache enabled* shows if the organization cache is enabled and links to the platform cache metadata.
.. *Org cache allocated* shows the size of the organization cache allocated and links to the platform cache configuration.
.. *Session cache enabled* shows if the session cache is enabled and links to the platform cache metadata.
.. *Session cache allocated* shows the size of the session cache allocated and links to the platform cache configuration.

The *ACM Communities* section shows each of your API Community Manager communities.

Here you can choose to show all diagnostics (default) or only diagnostics to review, collapse all communities in the list, or create a new community.

Each API Community Manager community has options to open the community and to open the community builder, and shows three diagnostics:

. *Community status* shows if the community is active.
. *Public* shows if the community is public, and links to the builder where you can make the community public.
. *Published assets status* shows if any assets in API Community Manager incorrectly point to Exchange assets that no longer exist.

If your list of communities is empty, xref:create-community.adoc[Create a Community].

== User Access Tab

The user access tab shows the status of your guest user and member user configurations, including their permissions.

The guest user and member user categories list their configuration items. Items that are not yet configured correctly have an error and a *Fix* button, and their category has a *Fix All* button. Correctly configured items and categories have no button and a green circle with a white check mark.
This configuration only works for the default ACM configuration, if you have a different configuration using public groups and rules, you should not click this button or use this diagnostics tool for the Member user profile.

*Guest User* items:

* *Profile permission*
* *Classes permission*
* *Sharing rules*

*Member User* items:

* *Community profile*
* *Profile permission*
* *Classes permission*
* *Sharing set*
* *Account created*
* *Account assigned*
* *Account owner role*
* *Account visibility*

After the items from *Community profile* through *Account created* are correctly configured, assign the Salesforce account manually:

. In the control panel, click *Community Administration* > *Login & Registration*.
. Scroll to the section *Registration Page Configuration*.
. Enable *Allow customers and partners to self-register*.
. Set *Registration Page Type* to *Default Page*.
. Select your community's member user as the value for *Profile*.
. Enter your community's Salesforce account name as the value for *Account*.
. Click *Save*.
. In the diagnostics page, next to the *Member User* item *Account assigned*, click *Assign* to verify that the account is assigned correctly.
. Fix the remaining items in the list.
