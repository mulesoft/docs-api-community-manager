With ACM, you can create, organize, and publish content, including news,
tutorials, developer blog posts, and events, for your community.

This content is stored in Salesforce content management system (CMS) articles.
These articles are separate from the API documentation stored in Exchange.
The API release process includes API documentation updates, and the CMS article
release process is usually separate. Often a development team will lead the API
release process and a marketing team will lead the CMS article release process.

== Create a New Article in Salesforce CMS

NOTE: You can also author ACM content in https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=communities_cms_connect.htm&type=5[an external CMS system through CMS Connect, role=external, window=blank].

. In the ACM administrator interface, select *Manage CMS Content*. The Salesforce Community Cloud *Content Management* interface is displayed.
The *Content Management* interface is organized into these panels:

* *Content*: Lists each article in your community.
* *Collections*: Lists collections in your community, such as *News* for news articles and *Blogs* for blog posts. Each collection is a list of articles.
* *Topics*: Lists article Topic groupings. Topics are similar to tags.
* *Recommendations*: Drives community engagement by recommending videos, trainings, events, and more for your users.
. Select *Salesforce CMS*. The *Salesforce CMS* interface displays the workspaces in your Salesforce organization.
TIP: The *Salesforce CMS* interface enables other teams, such as marketing or business development, to own the creation and publication of content articles in a single place, and reuse content across multiple communities.
. Select the workspace in which you want to create the new article. A tab for that workspace is displayed
that contains a list of the workspace's content articles.
. Select *Add Content*.
. Fill in the article's *Title*, *Body*, *Featured Image*, and *Excerpt*. The *Excerpt* is the preview text on an article's carousel tile.
. When finished with your changes, select *Save Draft*. You can edit and save the draft again any number of times.
. When you are ready to publish the article, select *Publish*.

== Add the Article to a Collection

. Select *Edit*. Articles selected to be part of the collection have green check marks to the left of their names.
. Select the plus sign (`+`) next to your new article to add it to the collection.

The collection now lists your new article.

The https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=community_managed_content_collections.htm&type=5[Salesforce Community Cloud documentation, role=external, window=blank] describes additional ways to add articles to collections, and includes more advanced categorization capabilities using topics and rules.

== Display the Collection in Your Community

. Return to the ACM administrator interface and select *Community Builder*. A preview of your community's site is displayed.
. If the collection containing your new article is already displayed in a *CMS Collection* component, then your new article will be visible there.
. Your article will be visible in any new *CMS Collection* components displaying the collection containing the article.

== Create Collections to Organize Content

. In the ACM administrator interface, select *Manage CMS Content*.
. Select *Collections*.
. Select *New*.
. Enter a name for your collection, select the source *CMS Content*, and choose to curate the collection *Manually*.
. From the list of community articles, select the ones you want to include in the collection by selecting the plus sign (`+`) next to each article.
. Select *Finish*.
. To use your new collection on your community site, go to the ACM administrator interface and select the *Community Builder* link.
. Add a *CMS Collection* component to a page in your community.
. Select the component to open its configuration menu, and select *Change Collection* to select your new collection.
