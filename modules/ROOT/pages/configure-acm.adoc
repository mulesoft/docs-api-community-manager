Follow these steps to configure API Community Manager (ACM).

NOTE: Installing, updating or configuring ACM must be done by a user account with the *System Administrator* profile in the ACM Salesforce organization.

NOTE: If your Anypoint Platform organization is https://docs.mulesoft.com/eu-control-plane/platform-access-eu[hosted in the EU region, role=external, window=_blank] you must replace all occurrences of the `anypoint.mulesoft.com` domain with `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` in all the steps in this section.

== Create and Authenticate the External Data Source [[create-and-authenticate-the-external-data-source]]

The external data source specifies how ACM components and data objects interact securely with your MuleSoft Anypoint organization.

=== Create a Connected App [[create-a-connected-app]]

You can perform this step either with the user interface or with an API call.

==== Create a Connected App with the User Interface [[create-a-connected-app-with-the-user-interface]]

To create a connected app with the user interface, in Anypoint Platform, navigate to *Access Management* -> *Applications* -> *Create New Application*, and provide the following information:

. *Application Name*: Enter a name.
. *Redirect URIs*: This URL can be found in the Authentication Provider configuration. Navigate
to *Salesforce Setup* -> *Auth. Providers* -> *Anypoint* -> *Callback URL*.
. *User Grant Types*
.. *Authorization Code*: Checked.
.. *Refresh Token*: Checked.
.. *Full Access*: Checked
.. *Background Access*: Checked.
. Select *Create Application*.

==== Create a Connected App with an API Call [[create-a-connected-app-with-an-api-call]]

To create a connected app with an API call, follow this example using `cURL`.

Get an authorization token from the platform:

----
    curl --silent https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login -XPOST \
      -d 'username=<anypoint username>&password=<anypoint password>'
----

This returns a response like this:

----
    {
      "access_token": "5242XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXfec7",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "redirectUrl": "/home/"
    }
----

Note the `access_token` value.

Use the next `cURL` example to register an external client in Anypoint for OpenID authentication.

Replace the access token in the authorization header with the `access_token` value.

Replace `[YourOrgDomain]` with your Salesforce organization domain name. Find the domain name by logging in to your Salesforce organization, selecting *Setup*, and selecting the section *My Domain*.

----
    curl -X POST \
      https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/connectedApplications \
      -H 'Accept: */*' \
      -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer 5242XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXfec7' \
      -H 'Host:anypoint.mulesoft.com' \
      -d '{"client_name":"SalesforceApp","grant_types":["authorization_code","refresh_token"],"redirect_uris":["https://[YourOrgDomain].my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"],"scopes":["full","offline_access"],"public_keys":[]}'
----

The `cURL` command will return a response like this:

----
    {
      "client_id": "5fafXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX29c9",
      "client_secret": "9509XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXC10E",
      "client_name": "ACM Integration Client",
      "redirect_uris": [
        "https://[YourOrgDomain].my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/Anypoint"
      ],
      "grant_types": [
        "authorization_code",
        "refresh_token"
      ],
      "public_keys": [],
      "scopes": [
        "offline_access",
        "full"
      ],
      "enabled": true,
      "owner_org_id": "f377XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX9d08",
      "as_id": "anypoint"
    }
----

Note the `client_id` and `client_secret` values.

=== Create Your Authentication Provider [[create-your-authentication-provider]]

. Set the *Token Endpoint URL* to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token+` .
. Set the *Default Scopes* to `full offline_access`.
. Select *Save*.

NOTE: Remember to associate the external data source with this authentication provider.

== Set Up User Impersonation [[set-up-user-impersonation]]

Impersonation links each community member to an Anypoint user. This connects the
Anypoint and community users and their client applications, so that applications are
created under the correct user, and actions in audit logs are recorded accurately.

Impersonation uses SAML, and it requires an Identity Provider (IdP) to be configured in both Anypoint Platform and Salesforce organizations. You can use Salesforce as an IdP, as described in the following sections.

=== Configure Salesforce as a SAML Identity Provider [[configure-salesforce-as-a-saml-identity-provider]]

To set up SAML in your Salesforce organization:

. Scroll to *Custom Attributes*.
. Add the first name attribute:
.. Select *New*.
.. Type `firstname` in the *Attribute key* field.
.. Select *Insert Field*.

.. Click *Insert Field*.
.. Select *$User >* -> *Last Name* -> *Insert* -> *Save*.

=== Configure External Identity in Your Anypoint Organization [[configure-external-identity-in-your-anypoint-organization]]

In your connected app screen, select *Manage*. Make a note of the URIs under the *SAML Login Information* to use them in the Anypoint configuration in the following steps.

Also, select *Download metadata* and retrieve the public key in the `<ds:X509Certificate>` tag inside the XML file.

. Log in to your Anypoint organization.
. Navigate to *Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Identity Management* -> *SAML 2.0*.
. Set *Sign On URL* to *IdP-Initiated Login URL*.

. Set *Issuer* to match the Salesforce account: `salesforce_org_domainname`.
. Set the *Public Key* to the public key extracted from the `<ds:X509Certificate>` tag in the metadata XML you downloaded.
. Set *Audience* to match the *Entity Id* you set in the Salesforce account.
. Select *Save*.

=== Configure and Authorize the ODATA Bridge to Perform Impersonation [[configure-and-authorize-the-odata-bridge-to-perform-impersonation]]

This step requires a private key or a certificate, and a keystore (JKS) containing that key or certificate.
Use the same certificate that Salesforce IDP uses.

. Select *Export to Keystore* in the *Certificates* section.
. Enter a new Password.

. Go to *Users* and open your user.
.. Select *Secrets Manager*.
.. Set *Environment* to the newly created environment: `ACM`.
.. Select all permissions in *Permissions*.
.. Select the plus button.
. To apply these changes, log out and then log back in.

. Go to *Secrets Manager* and select the ACM environment using the environment switcher. Select *Create Secret Group* and enter the following information:
.. Set *Name* to *Certificates*.
.. Select *Secret Group Downloadable*.
.. Select *Save*.
.. Select *Keystore*.

=== Mapping Community User to Anypoint Role [[mapping-community-user-to-anypoint-role]]

. In your Anypoint Platform organization, navigate to *Access Management* and select *Roles*.
. In *Exchange Viewers*, set a new External group called `Community User` and save it.

*IMPORTANT*: If you choose to use another key or certificate for the impersonation feature,
you must add this key in the External Identity configuration on Anypoint, as shown in the following steps:

. In Anypoint, select *Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Edit*.
. Add your key in *Public Key*:
.. Copy the key with no line breaks.
.. After the key displayed in the *Public Key* field, add a comma (`,`) and then paste in the new key.
.. Select *Save*.
