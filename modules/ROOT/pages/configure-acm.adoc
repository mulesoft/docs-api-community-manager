To open API Community Manager, first select the *App Launcher*. The App Launcher icon
is the first icon displayed in the main navigation bar. Then select *API Community Manager*.

== Authenticate the External Data Source [[authenticate-the-external-data-source]]

The external data source specifies how to access the MuleSoft Anypoint system.

. Search for *External Data Source* in the *Quick Find* box and then select *External Data Sources*.
. Select *Exchange* and then select *Edit*.
. Update *Identity Type* to *Named Principal*.
. Update *Authentication Protocol* to *OAuth 2.0*.
. Update *Authentication Provider* to *Anypoint*.
. Select *Save*. The *Anypoint Login* page is shown.
. Log in to the Anypoint Platform.
. Search for *External Data Source* in the *Quick Find* box and then select *External Data Sources*.
The *External Data Sources* information for Exchange shows the *Authentication Status* is *Authenticated*.
If you experience problems, check the Auth. Provider callback endpoint and your domain
configuration in xref:reference.adoc[Configuration Reference].
. Search for *Named Credentials* in the *Quick Find* box and then select *Named Credentials*.
. Select *Edit*.
. In the *Authentication* section, enter the Anypoint username and password in the *Username* and
*Password* fields, respectively.
. Select *Save*.

== Give Permissions to ACM Community Manager [[give-permissions-to-acm-community-manager]]

If you cannot view ACM Community Manager content in the *Lightning Experience App Manager*, you must
add the *ACM Administrator* tab from the App Manager in *Setup*:

. In *Setup*, search for App Manager using the *Quick Find* box, select *API Community Manager*, and then edit it.
. Navigate to *Navigation Items*, highlight *ACM Administrator*, and move it to the *Selected Items* column. Select *Save*.
. Log out and log back in to your Salesforce organization.
. In the *ACM Administrator* tab, select *Manage APIs*.
. Select the APIs you want to show in the Community portal using *Add to Community*.

. Navigate to *Setup -> Users* and select your username.
. Set the appropriate *Role*.
. Select *Save*.

== Configure EU account [[configure-eu-account]]

If you have an EU account, which is
https://docs.mulesoft.com/eu-control-plane/platform-access-eu[hosted within the EU, role=external, window=_blank],
you must authenticate, set up and configure your domain, and manage your APIs, applications, and related data
using the following URL: `eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`. This is because the EU control plane stores all MuleSoft data
within the EU, and you cannot access EU account data and information using the US Anypoint Platform control plane URL.

To use API Community Manager in an EU region, you must change all occurrences of `anypoint.mulesoft.com`
to include a `eu1` prefix. For example: you must update the `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/odatabridge/odata.svc`
External Data Source configuration URL to: `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/odatabridge/odata.svc`.

The following list contains the required updates:

* Named Credentials URL when you <<authenticate-the-external-data-source>>: Change `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com` to `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`.
* *Authorize Endpoint URL* when you Configure the Auth Provider during <<set-up-user-impersonation>>:
Change
`https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/authorize` to `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/authorize`.
* *Token Endpoint URL* when you Configure the Auth Provider during <<set-up-user-impersonation>>:
Change `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/token`
to `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/oauth2/token`.
* Remote site settings : Add the new site `AnypointEu` with the URL `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`.
* CSP trusted sites: Add the following sites:

** `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com`
** `https://exchange2-file-upload-service-kprod-eu.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
** `https://exchange2-asset-manager-kprod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com`

.... Set *Issuer* to *salesforce_org_domainname*.
.... Set *IdP Certificate* to *Default IdP Certificate*.

.... Navigate to your Salesforce app enabled for SAML and select *Manage* to see all the URIs to be used to set up
external identity in Anypoint. Make a note of these URIs for quick reference.
.... Switch to your Anypoint account. Navigate to
*Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Identity Management* -> *SAML 2.0*.
.... Set *Sign On URL* to *IdP-Initiated Login URL*.
.... Set *Sign Off URL* to *Single Logout Endpoint*.

.... To find your Public Key, find Identity Provider, select *Download certificate*, and
open the certificate in a text editor. Copy all of the content and paste it into the *Public Key* field.
Alternatively, you can download metadata from the Salesforce app and extract the certificate from it.
.... Set *Audience* to match the *Entity Id* you set in the Salesforce account.
.... Select *Save*.

. Configure and Authorize ODATA Bridge to Perform Impersonation

** This final step requires a private key or a certificate, and a keystore (JKS) containing that key or certificate. Use the same certificate that Salesforce IDP uses.

.. Mapping Community User to Anypoint Role

... Navigate to *Access Management* and select *Roles*.
... In *Exchange Viewers*, set a new External group called `Community User` and save it.

... *IMPORTANT*: If you choose to use another key or certificate for the impersonation feature,
you must add this key in the External Identity configuration on Anypoint, as shown in the following steps:

.... In Anypoint, select *Access Management* -> *External Identity* -> *Edit*.
.... Add your key in *Public Key*:

..... Copy the key with no line breaks.
..... After the key displayed in the *Public Key* field, add a comma (,) and then paste in the new key.
