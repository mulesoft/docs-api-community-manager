The anonymous guest user profile contains the Exchange Viewer permission that gives access to all assets in Exchange with this visibility.
An anonymous user can potentially exploit this visibility and access assets that are not intended for them. 

To troubleshoot this issue, ensure that anonymous guest users and community users can only access intended and required assets.

. Create a new team in Access Management called Guest Community Users and create a new mapping for External Idp Groups called Community Guest.
. In Salesforce, change the Named Credential authentication information.
. In Exchange, share the assets with the Guest Community Users team.
. In Access Management, remove the ability for guest users to see the inherited permissions from the Exchange Viewer permission.
